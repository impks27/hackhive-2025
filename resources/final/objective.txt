Objective: Classify the provided email into the most appropriate categories based on the descriptions and sample emails provided for each category. The text can contain requests for multiple transactions each belonging to a distinct category. If the email contains text that belongs to multiple categories, create a JSON array where each object represents a distinct category and its associated fields and the text from the email that supports the classification. Include a confidence score for each classification. Never combine data for similar categories. Keep them separate.
