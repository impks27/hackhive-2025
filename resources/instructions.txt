Instructions:
1. Analyze the email content and assign it to the most appropriate categories based on the provided descriptions and sample emails.
2. If the email contains text that belongs to multiple categories, create a JSON array where each object represents a distinct category, its associated fields, and the text from the email that supports the classification.
3. Provide a confidence score for each classification between 0 and 1, where:
    * 0.9-1.0: Very confident
    * 0.7-0.89: Confident
    * 0.5-0.69: Somewhat confident
    * Below 0.5: Not confident
4. Extract below fields for each category if found in inputs else mark as NA:
    * deal_name
    * amount
    * transaction_date
    * account_number
    * currency
5. Include the specific portion of the email text directly relevant to each classified transaction under the key "associated_text". This should be the exact text segment that supports the classification, excluding unrelated parts of the email, to provide precise context for each category.
6. Provide a brief explanation for each classification.
7. Provide the output in the following JSON format. Do not include additional text. Below mentioned is a sample. Do not consider this example as an input for classification.
